Role: Head of Mathematics

During high school, I collaborated with a group of friends to create a competitive exam for middle school students. I took the lead in designing the mathematics sectionâ€”crafting challenging yet fair problems.

The exam was well-received, selling over 500 copies, and became a rewarding learning experience for all of us involved. Although the project is no longer active, it holds meaningful memories for me. It was one of the first times I saw how ideas, teamwork, and running a business could come together to create something that generated real income.
